During my Erasmus exchange stay at KU Leuven, Belgium in 2019 I was a part of a project for course called Design of Software Systems.
We were working on OWASP ZAP which is an open-source web application security scanner. 

The objectives of this group project were:  
-analyzing the quality of an existing design.  
-deciding what parts of an existing system need to be changed to allow for new functionality.  
-designing software for new functionality without breaking the existing software system.  
-writing reports that clearly convey the proposed changes and design decisions.  

Except for the above stated objectives my tasks also revolved around:  
-coding extensions for the application  
-creating JUnit tests  
-creating UML diagrams
