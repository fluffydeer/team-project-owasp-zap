1. Show where typosquat?

Up to us: just show original and confused is probs best.

2. Site blacklisted, do we immediately redirect next time?

(--Better to ask again probably--)
No, redirect immediately, because it makes more sense

Do we need to be able to revert decisions?

Not specified => Shouldn't make ik more difficult than strictly specified in assignment.
"it's only an assignment"

3. Typosquat + multiple options?

Yes, show multiple options
=> Similarity functions + sort based on that.
(not required to prioritize, but just show multiple that are possible)

+ Show multiple redirect options

3. Do not proceed?

Yes, goes to the blank/home-page of the browser.

===========================================================

Extending ZAPROXY:

Passive/active:

scanHTTPRequestSend() called before send, other after response.
	=> Alter response in method that received response
	Harm is done in the content.
	We can wait until response to check.

No redirection, generate new page with options and send out.

User clicks button => url should indicate what user selected and so ZAP can filter out (see parameter indicates it's trusted).
html submit button: action-param is url. Then url has param that indicates it's ok => SECURE, not fixed param (random generated stuff : UUID for example).

===========================================================

DIAGRAMS

Fine to add pscanner in the core in list of extensions.
Should implement extensions using Gradle (add new gradle project).
NOT modify ZAPROXY core.

=> Maybe look at za-extensions for example.

====

Suggestion: Comply with ZAPROXY terminology (PassiveScanner etc).
			Controller, why?

			PassiveScan: only two methods => only two interactions. (Not 3rd and 4th)
						Redirect is just new url, therefore not ZAP that does redirect.
						Controller is redundant, is doing exactly what scanner should do.

Not a good idea to let constructor generate HTML, better have method => some kind of factory.
	Call when need html => generate in method.

Also raise alert.

UserDecision: good that it's seperated.

-> Redundancy removed + adapt names, rest ok.

==========================================================

Regex is ok for typosquat detection.
Also search for similarity-functions. Not in ZAPROXY, in external lib (that's ok).

seperate project in same workspace, will generate .JAR, look up interaction with ZAP.

Whitelist: 	initialize ourselves. Should keep track because it's stated in the assignment.
			large? just domainname. Intermediate cache of some size.
				=> HashMap of specific site, always check size of map.
