file system typosquating

whitelist and blacklist
two seperate files?

whitelist contains all visited sites but no garanty that it is save. First visit can be a typo.
BlackList contains sites that the user has indicated to be wrong/unsafe.
Possibility to change a whitelisted or black listed domain name?

load lists in to memory on boot?
	- adv: faster loading times for sites
	- disadv: possibly slower program start, but since addons run in there seperate thread this may not be a problem
	- disadv: sets may be to big, use to much memory

	possibly an intermediate solution with caching of often used/last used sites

check:
	- always typosquating test or first lookup in white and blacklist?
	- test is probably faster than lookup in both lists

functionality:
	- load file
	- isWhiteListed()
	- isBlackListed()
	- addToWhiteList()
	- addToBlackList()
	- remove?

design:
	- AbstractFileClass -> WhiteListFile, BlackListFile
	or FileController to do everything

Zaproxy has a file manager build in, creating and reading files seem to be simple method calls.
