17/11/2019:   Implementation of the .jar loader + start of UI implementation
              Implementation of the 5 suggested rule classes. Still in need of 2 extra classes.

19/11/2019:   Small update done on one of the Rule classes.
              Fixed last part of the UI implementation: 
              You can now load a .jar from the Analyse menu in ZAP

20/11/2019:   Update of the class diagram done: model view controller pattern:
              model (ExtensionPolicyRuleVerifier) 
              view (PolicyRuleDialog) 
              controller (PolicyJarLoader)
              README file made to load a .jar file with our extension.

21/11/2019:   realized there are some issues running the extension on Windows
              on Mac it runs perfectly: still unknown what the exact problem is.

22/11/2019:   9h-9h30: short status meeting
              9h30-10h: meeting with supervisor, see meeting notes for more details
