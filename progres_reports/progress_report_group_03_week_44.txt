26/10/19:   Set up of the gradle tasks to build and deploy our addon in the zaproxy project.

27/10/19:   Implementation of our first design using the PassiveScannerPlugin.

28/10/19:   Team meeting from 8h - 11h30 to put together the implementation that was written over the weekend.
            Implementation based on the PassiveScannerPlugin.

29/10/19:   Team meeting from 16h - 18h: new class diagram constructed.
            Did some tests on using the PassiveScannerPlugin: we found out that the passive scanner does not block any incoming requests.
            The passive scanner only scans through every request and response, but sends it through to the server in any case.
            
30/10/19:   Testing with other classes in Parosproxy: the OverwriteMessageProxyListener can overwrite http requests and responses.
            We can then extend the ExtensionAdapator and implement the OverwriteMessageProxyListener
            
31/10/19:   Team meeting from 15h - 18h to implement the new design. Meeting scheduled with supervisor at 16h 
            but the supervisor didn't show. We will reschedule a new meeting the next week.
            Divided tasks among the team members to finish the current code. We aim to hand in this user story next week.
